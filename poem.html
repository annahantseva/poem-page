            Gabby bought a baby beagle at the <br>
            beagle baby store. Gabby gave her beagle <br> 
            kibble, but he begged for bagels more.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Gabby loved her baby beagle; gladly <br>
            Gabby gave him one, but her beagle <br>
            grabbed the bag and gulped them down <br> 
            till there were none.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="line_3">
            So she took her baby beagle<br> 
            to the bagel baker's store,<br> 
            where the beagle gobbled <br>
            bagels, bags of bagels by the score.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Gabby's beagle gorged on bagels, bigger <br>
            bagels than before,<br> 
            till he'd gobbled every <br>
            bagel in the baker's bagel store.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Gulping bagels bulges baby beagles' <br>
            bellies really big. Say goodbye to baby <br>
            beagle; Gabby's beagle's now a pig.<br>
